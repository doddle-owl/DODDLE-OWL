One can become member of the Volley tennis club by sending a letter to the club by postal mail. In that letter one has to mention surname and first name, birth date, sex, telephone number, and postal address (street, house number, zip code, and residence). Charles, the administrator of Volley, empties daily the mailbox and checks whether the information provided is complete. If not, he makes a telephone call to the sender in order to complete the data. If a letter is completed, Charles adds an incoming mail number and the date, records the letter in the letter book, and archives it.
Every Wednesday evening, Charles takes the collected letters to Miranda, the Secretary of Volley. He also takes the member register with him. If Miranda decides that an applicant will become member of Volley, she stamps 'new member' on the letter and writes the date below it. This date is the commencement date of the membership. She then hands the letter to Charles in order to add the new member to the member register. This is a book with numbered lines. Each new member is entered on a new line. The line number is the member number, by which the new member is referenced in the administration.
Next, Miranda calculates the membership fee that the new member has to pay for the remaining part of the Calendar year. She finds the amount due for annual fees, as decided at the general meeting, on a piece of paper in the drawer of her desk. Then, she asks Charles to write down the amount in the member register.If Miranda does not allow an applicant to become a member (e.g., because he or she is too young or because the maximum number of members has been reached), Charles will send a letter in which he explains why the applicant cannot (yet) become a member of Volley.
lf all applications are processed, Charles takes the letters and the member register home and prepares an invoice to all new members for the payment of the first fee. He sends these invoices by postal mail. Payments have to be performed by bank transfers.
As soon as a Payment is received, Charles prints a membership card on which are mentioned the membership number, the commencement date, the name, the birth date, and the postal address. The card is sent to the new member by postal mail.
